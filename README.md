# TODO
 - [ ] i18n
 - [x] eslint
 - [ ] service workers
 - [ ] fingerprinting
 - [ ] better way to do polybuild


#### thoughts
* should there be a useref-like directive for vulcanize/polybuild, whats the value?
* watch should accept params and then default

#### assumptions to document
* components won't have html with nested js and css
* all assets in components are copies over, however only html assets are processed
