# TODO
 - [ ] i18n
 - [ ] eslint
 - [ ] service workers
 - [ ] fingerprinting


#### thoughts
* should there be a useref-like directive for vulcanize/polybuild, whats the value?
* watch should accept params and then default
* look at eslint instead of jshint

#### assumptions to document
* components won't have html with nested js and css
* all assets in components are copies over, however only html assets are processed
